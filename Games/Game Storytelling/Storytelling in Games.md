### 06. What is my motivation:

``The Protagonist(s)``

  how much agency does the player have in deciding this?

Make your protagonist interesting:

- Show they're willing to sacrifice themselves for others
- Show their misfortune is underserved
- Share their painful past
- Show they are brave
- Taking responsibility for them


`The Antagonist(s)`

- What does the antagonist want?
- How do their wants make things hard for the player?
- What are they willing to do to get what they want?


`NPCs`

- What do other people want?
- Are they helping or hindering the  player?
- Do their motivations make sense? 
- What is their end goal?


### 07. Delivering your story

Deliver the story in breadcrumbs, don't throw the whole loaf at the player all at once.

`Environmental Storytelling:`
Make use of sounds, whispers, silence, music to tell stories.
