`Jordan B.Peterson`
`Summary: Ahmad Wali Sharify`

First of All:
Don't Be *Dishearted* Especially if you are young, because of course you are useless and stupid.
The Question is What You gonna do about it.

### What Should Do With Your Life?

- Look At What Others do, that appears to make them a meaningful life.
	- Intimate Partner
`you are not going to find the person you are attracted to. who the hell are you so per say? and how you know if she looks at you don't run away screaming!`
`it is about being the person that your other wants.`

#### What do you bring to the table?
-  *youth* and *possibilities*.
- good at something, `if not, pick one thing and be good at it`

`Develop a vision, what partner you want? what job you want? can you regulate your low desires?`
`Who the hell someone cares about your believes? you don't really have believes.` 

### Define What Makes a Man:

#### *Productive Generosity*

it is the difference between conciseness and agreeableness,
*Agreeableness is an empathy dimension that has no correlation with Success!*

Productive Generosity as central notion.
Productivity Requires:
	-  Aim
	- Orientation
	- Responsibility
		- Yourself
			- Your community of selves
		- Wife
		- Children
		- Parents
		- Local Community
		- Broader Community
	- Discipline
	- Willingness
	- Sacrifice

this Orientates you. it gives you a **dragon** to fight, a real one.
That where the *gold* is. 

### How You Can Arm Yourself?

	- Arm Yourself with Words
	- Precise With Your Language
	- Say What You Mean
	- Get Your Tongue in Order
	- Get rid of the ums, and ahhs and you knows
	- stop saying things to just impress other people 
	- start saying what you mean
- *Read*
	- Read Great Men
	- Make Yourself Literate
- Beauty
- Tradition
- Community
- Write
	- To Think

~~~
if you are not speaking the truth, who is talking!?
if you say something you are not really think it is true. its not you talking. there a part of you to manipulate others for delivering the things you want. what is that. you are just turned in to that. when you got something it is not you that get that, its your manipulative you. if you do that your whole life, you are not having your own life. it not a difference between you and demonic position. you miss your adventure of your own life. 

the great people are brutally truthful. and they got more and more competent. 

how can what is unreal prevail over what is real?

The score goes to those on mastering abstractions. 
education is the path way to sharpness of mind and tongue.
