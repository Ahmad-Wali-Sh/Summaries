### 14. **Licensing and Anti-Piracy Features (Relevant to Your Setup):**

- **Software Licensing and Device Binding:**
    - As you mentioned earlier, using **device-bound authentication** will help prevent unauthorized usage or copying of your software to other machines. However, also consider implementing **license keys** that activate only on designated devices.
    - Integrate a **license management system** to handle different levels of access, trial periods, or premium features, and ensure unauthorized installations are prevented.


### Summary:

Your **SaaS medicine/pharmacy software** should not only handle the **core pharmacy operations** like **inventory, prescriptions, and billing**, but also provide **advanced capabilities** like **cloud-based access**, **data security**, and **analytics** to enhance decision-making. By adding **value-added features** like AI integration, **telemedicine**, and **customer notifications**, you can differentiate your product from competitors. Keep in mind the need for **scalability, security, and compliance** to ensure your solution can handle a growing user base while staying compliant with medical and legal regulations.
